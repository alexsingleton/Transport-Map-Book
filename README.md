Transport Map Book
==================

The Transport Map Books are available for each local authority district in England and each comprises a series of maps created using the following data:

* Travel to work flows (Middle Super Output Areas) from the 2011 Census
* [Accessibility Statistics](http://www.dft.gov.uk/statistics/series/accessibility/) created by the DfT (Lower Super Output Areas)
* $CO^2$ estimates for the commute to school during 2011 (Lower Super Output Areas)
* Travel to work mode (Output Areas)
* Distance and travel to work mode (Workplace Zones)

The maps are automated in R, and the code provided.
